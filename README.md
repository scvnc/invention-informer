# Invention informer

I'm tired of seeing job offers with hilariously lame employment agreements.

There are some that are worse than others but it boils down to:

> - You have a right to your own inventions so long as 
>   - Inventions are not created on company time & resources
>   - They do not pertain to the business
> - When you have a new invention, you have to inform the company within X days for review so that WE can decide whether or not this invention is ours.


I don't think this works very well with the nature of software.


## Plans

- Script that collects and hashes your potential "inventions"
- Smiths it into the bitcoin blockchain for "proof of existence"
- A weekly task that gives you a report to review and send over to the person at your company that reviews your inventions.

## Key feature

Public stuff is fine, whatever, but what about private repos, private notes?  In theory this could prove that they existed without sharing the invention with the company or the public.
